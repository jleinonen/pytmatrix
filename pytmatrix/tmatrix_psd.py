class TMatrixPSD(Scatterer):
    """T-matrix class to perform computations over PSDs.

    This class derives from TMatrix to perform computations on particle
    ensembles given by a particle size distribution (PSD).

    Most class attributes can be set as in the TMatrix class, and there
    are several additional attributes. However, note that unlike with TMatrix,
    the results are based on lookup tables that are initialized with
    init_scatter_table. This means that after initializing 
    (init_scatter_table) or loading (load_scatter_table) the lookup tables,
    only changes to the PSD will have an effect on the results. To change
    other properties of the scattering problem (e.g. the refractive index m),
    you must rerun init_scatter_table.

    Initialize the class and set the attributes as described below. Call
    init_scatter_table to compute the lookup table for scattering values at
    different scatterer geometries. 

    The scattering properties can now be retrieved multiple times without
    re-initializing. Use set_geometry to select the geometry you need. 
    After this, you can call the same functions as with the TMatrix class to
    retrieve the scattering/radar parameters.

    Attributes:
        psd: set to a callable object giving the PSD value for a given 
            diameter (for example a GammaPSD instance); 
            default GammaPSD(D0=1.0)
        n_psd: the number of points for which to sample the PSD and scattering 
            properties for; default n_psd=500 should be good for most purposes
        psd_m_func: set to a callable object giving the refractive index as a
            function of diameter, or None to use the "m" attribute for all
            sizes; default None
        psd_eps_func: set to a callable object giving the aspect ratio
            (horizontal to rotational) as a function of diameter, or None to 
            use the "eps" attribute for all sizes; default None
        D_max: set to the maximum single scatterer size that is desired to be
            used (usually the D_max corresponding to the largest PSD you 
            intend to use)
        geoms: tuple containing the scattering geometry tuples that are 
            initialized (thet0, thet, phi0, phi, alpha, beta); 
            default horizontal backscatter
